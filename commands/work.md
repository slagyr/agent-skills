# Work on Next Bead

Pick up the next ready bead and work on it.

## Steps

1. Pull the latest code with `git pull`
2. Sync the latest bead state with `bd sync` (or equivalent `bd dolt` commands if `bd sync` is unavailable)
3. Run `bd ready` to find issues with no blockers
4. If no issues are ready, inform the user and stop
5. Select the highest priority issue (lowest P number) that is NOT in_progress
6. If the only ready issues are in_progress, select the highest priority issue and ask the user if they'd like to proceed. If they decline, stop
7. Show the issue details to the user with `bd show <id>`
8. Run `bd update <id> --status=in_progress` to claim it
9. Sync bead state again with `bd sync` so the claim is visible to other workers
10. Implement the issue, following any applicable project skills and conventions

## When Complete

1. Ensure all unit tests/specs pass
2. If the bead references approved feature scenarios, ensure those scenarios pass and are not pending
3. If the bead references approved feature scenarios, do not close the bead while those scenarios remain pending
4. If the bead references approved feature scenarios, do not change approved feature direction without review; if feature text and implementation diverge, stop and raise it
5. If broader feature or test runs fail only in scenarios outside the bead's scope, do not keep this bead open for that reason alone. Note the unrelated failures, and create or reference a separate bead to track them.
6. Check boot files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.), existing beads, or `bd` config for the project's status flow. Do not skip this step. Use whatever status the project defines as the next step after `in_progress`. If no conventions are documented, default to `bd close <id>`.
7. Sync beads state using the installed bd version (`bd sync` if available; otherwise use the equivalent `bd dolt` commands)
8. Commit code changes with a descriptive message

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS - Optional: specific issue ID to work on instead of picking from ready queue
