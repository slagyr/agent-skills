# Toolbox — Skill Management

Resolve, cache, and update skill dependencies declared in a project's `AGENTS.md`.

## When This Skill Applies

When you land in a project and `AGENTS.md` contains a `## Skills` section with a link to this skill (toolbox), follow the procedure below to ensure all declared skills are available locally before doing any work.

## How Skills Are Declared

Skills are declared in the project's `AGENTS.md` under a `## Skills` section. Each skill is a markdown link in a bullet list:

```markdown
## Skills

This project uses [toolbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-skills/main/skills/toolbox/SKILL.md) to manage skills. If `.skills/` doesn't exist, fetch the toolbox SKILL.md from the URL above and follow its instructions.

- [tdd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-skills/main/skills/tdd/SKILL.md)
- [braids](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/braids/main/braids/SKILL.md)
```

- The **link text** is the skill name.
- The **URL** points to the skill's `SKILL.md` entry point.
- Both `https://` and `file://` URLs are supported.

## Procedure

### 1. Check for Cached Skills

Look for `.skills/toolbox.json` in the project root.

- **If it exists**: skills have been fetched before. Check freshness (see §4).
- **If it doesn't exist**: bootstrap (see §2).

### 2. Bootstrap (First Run)

When `.skills/toolbox.json` is missing:

1. Create the `.skills/` directory in the project root.
2. Parse the `## Skills` section of `AGENTS.md` for skill links. Extract each `[name](url)` pair.
3. For each declared skill (including toolbox itself):
   a. Fetch `SKILL.md` from the skill's URL.
   b. Discover reference files by parsing relative markdown links in `SKILL.md` — patterns like `[text](references/foo.md)` or `[text](some/path.md)`. Only include links to relative paths (not absolute URLs or anchors).
   c. Compute the base URL by removing `SKILL.md` from the skill's URL. Fetch each discovered reference file relative to that base URL.
   d. Write all fetched files into `.skills/{name}/`, preserving directory structure.
4. Write `.skills/toolbox.json` with the manifest (see §3).
5. Ensure `.skills/` is listed in the project's `.gitignore`. If not, add it.

### 3. The Manifest — `.skills/toolbox.json`

The manifest tracks all cached skills, their source URLs, fetched files, and freshness metadata.

```json
{
  "freshness_hours": 24,
  "skills": {
    "toolbox": {
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-skills/main/skills/toolbox/SKILL.md",
      "fetched_at": "2026-03-06T12:00:00Z",
      "files": ["SKILL.md"]
    },
    "tdd": {
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-skills/main/skills/tdd/SKILL.md",
      "fetched_at": "2026-03-06T12:00:00Z",
      "files": ["SKILL.md"]
    },
    "braids": {
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/braids/main/braids/SKILL.md",
      "fetched_at": "2026-03-06T12:00:00Z",
      "files": [
        "SKILL.md",
        "references/worker.md",
        "references/orchestrator.md",
        "references/project-creation.md",
        "references/init.md",
        "references/migration.md",
        "references/agents-template.md",
        "references/coordinator-constraint-snippet.md",
        "references/worker-agent-template.md"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `freshness_hours` | How many hours before a skill is considered stale. Default: `24`. |
| `skills` | Map of skill name → skill entry. |
| `skills.{name}.url` | The URL from which `SKILL.md` was fetched. |
| `skills.{name}.fetched_at` | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the skill was last fetched. |
| `skills.{name}.files` | List of all files cached for this skill, relative to `.skills/{name}/`. |

### 4. Check Freshness

When `.skills/toolbox.json` exists, compare each skill's `fetched_at` to the current time.

- If `now - fetched_at > freshness_hours`: the skill is **stale**. Report it to the user:
  ```
  Stale skills detected:
    - tdd (last fetched 3 days ago)
    - braids (last fetched 2 days ago)
  Run skill update to refresh.
  ```
- If all skills are fresh: proceed silently. Do not report anything.

**Never auto-update.** Always ask the user before fetching new versions.

### 5. Update Skills

When the user asks to update skills (e.g., "update skills", "refresh skills"):

1. Re-parse `AGENTS.md` for the current skill declarations. This catches added or removed skills.
2. For each declared skill:
   a. Re-fetch `SKILL.md` from the URL.
   b. Re-discover and fetch reference files.
   c. Overwrite the cached files in `.skills/{name}/`.
   d. Update `fetched_at` in the manifest.
3. Remove any cached skills that are no longer declared in `AGENTS.md`.
4. Write the updated `.skills/toolbox.json`.

### 6. Read Skills

When you need to read a skill's content during a session, read from `.skills/{name}/SKILL.md`. References are at `.skills/{name}/references/` (or wherever the skill's relative links point).

## URL Schemes

### `https://`

Fetch via HTTP GET. This is the primary use case for portable, published skills.

For skills hosted on GitHub, use `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md
```

To pin a specific version, use a commit SHA instead of a branch name:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{sha}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md
```

### `file://`

Copy from the local filesystem. Useful for:
- Skills under active development
- Private skills that won't be published
- Migration from filesystem-based skill references

Example:
```markdown
- [braids](file:///Users/micah/Projects/braids/braids/SKILL.md)
```

**Note:** `file://` URLs are not portable across machines. Use `https://` for skills that need to work everywhere.

## Reference Discovery

When fetching a skill's `SKILL.md`, parse it for relative markdown links to discover supporting files.

**Match patterns:**
- `[text](references/foo.md)` — standard markdown link with relative path
- `[text](some/path.md)` — any relative path (no scheme, no leading `/`)

**Exclude:**
- Absolute URLs (`https://...`, `http://...`, `file://...`)
- Anchor links (`#section`)
- Non-markdown files (unless explicitly linked)

**Resolve:** Given a skill URL like `https://example.com/skills/solid/SKILL.md`, the base URL is `https://example.com/skills/solid/`. A reference `references/tdd.md` resolves to `https://example.com/skills/solid/references/tdd.md`.

For `file://` URLs, the same logic applies using filesystem paths.
