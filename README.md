# Agent Lib

A library of reusable skills, commands, and other agent components for AI coding agents.

Components are managed by [toolbox](https://github.com/slagyr/toolbox).

## Structure

```
agent-lib/
  skills/       # Skills teach agents how to behave in specific contexts
  commands/     # Commands define reusable agent actions
```

## Usage

Add component sections to your project's boot file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.) and reference components by URL:

```markdown
## Skills

This project uses [toolbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/toolbox/main/SKILL.md)
to manage components. If `.toolbox/` doesn't exist, fetch the toolbox SKILL.md
from the URL above and follow its instructions.
